/**

*
* This file contains a design example using the General Purpose I/O (TTLMEMBUS) low
* level driver and hardware device. It only uses a channel 1 of a TTLMEMBUS device.
*
* <pre>
* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date	 Changes
* ----- ---- -------- -----------------------------------------------
* 1.00b jhl  04/29/02 First release
* 2.00a jhl  12/30/02 Addition of dual channel capability
* 2.00a sv   04/18/05 Minor changes to comply to Doxygen and coding guidelines
* 3.00a ktn  11/21/09 Removed the macros XTtlMemBus_mSetDataDirection,
*		      XTtlMemBus_mGetDataReg and XTtlMemBus_mSetDataReg. Users
*		      should use XTtlMemBus_WriteReg/XTtlMemBus_ReadReg to achieve the
*		      same functionality.
